It's taking a cue from github project Hotfix.
Maybe you need gorrvy plugin if you want to compiled it . 
Move the compiled dex file to your server dir, and modify download url 
Normal class and activity can fix, but application class
Run project first chek if need updata App, then the bug app show 'This is a bug' on MainActivity and item 'bug item' show in ListActivity
Updata your updata file, Then restart App 'This is a bug' will be replace 'The bug is fixed' and item will be became 'fix bug item'
